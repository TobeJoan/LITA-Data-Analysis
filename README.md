  ### Microsoft Excel
  - We were taught how to input data into spreadsheet, create and format worksheets and avoid common errors while inputting or handling data.
  - We were taught various excel functions that helped with: Text, Numbers, LookUp and creating Pivot Tables that help to summarize large amount of data.
