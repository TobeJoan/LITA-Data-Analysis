  ## Introduction to Data Analysis
  ### "The Capacity to learn is a gift, the ability to learn is a skill, the willingness to learn is a choice"  ~ Brian Herbert
  Data Analysis is the process of systematically collecting, transforming, and organizing data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision making. The foundation of data are: 
  - Data Generation: Collation of Data
  - Data Structure: Structured, Unstructured and Semi-structured formats
  - Data Storage: Data can be stored on premises i.e within an organisation using a centralised system called a server; or on the cloud, i.e data warehouses or data centers
  - Data Analysis: It starts with connecting to a data source to collect data (INGESTION), changing or editing the format of the data (TRANSFORMATION), connecting tables to make a single report (MODELING), building charts or graphs (VISUALISATIONS), using statistical tools to understand the data (ANALYSIS) and ends with presenting the data to the client (PRESENTATION).
  ### Why Data Analysis???
We use data analysis to help business know
- What is working?
- What is not working?
- What to focus on
  
  For the purpose of the training, we focused on learning the use of these three different softwares:
  
 - Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng)
  
 - Structured Query Language (SQL)
  
 - Microsoft Power BI [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi)

  ### Microsoft Excel
  It is a spreadsheet application used to store and analyse data. We were taught how to input data into spreadsheet, create and format worksheets and avoid common errors while inputting or handling data. We were taught various excel functions that helped with: Text, Numbers, LookUp and creating Pivot Tables that help to summarize large amount of data. 
  We were given a project, Capstone Project where we apply all we had been taught in Excel, SQL and Power BI.
  The tasks given were: 
- Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
- Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
- Create any other interesting report

  ### Structured Query Language
  Structured query language (SQL) is a standard language for database creation and manipulation. It is a relational database program that uses SQL queries. We learnt functions like SELECT, JOIN, DINSTINCT, LEFT, FULL AND RIGHT JOIN, SUM, e.t.c

For the Capstone Project, the tasks given were to:
- retrieve the total sales for each product category.
- find the number of sales transactions in each region.
- find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
- calculate total revenue per product.
- calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
- find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
- identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
  
  ### Power BI
  Power BI is a data visualization platform used primarily for business intelligence purposes. It is used to create reports and dashboards that present data sets in multiple ways using visuals. It turns data into a wide range of different visuals, including pie charts combo charts, bar and column charts, and ribbon charts, among many other options
